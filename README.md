### District Summary changes
---
After completing the initial analysis, the school district requested Thomas High School freshmen data be excluded due to anomalous results.  Here are those observations:

The overall results for the entire school system did not see a significant impact to overall results.  The 9th graders at Thomas High School comprise only about 1.0% of the student population of the system (461 out of 39170).

Impacts to Thomas High School
---
Thomas High School's overall rank dropped from being the top in reading, number two overall and top half of schools in Math to a rank of #8 in overall school performance.  It dropped from 4th to 6th in overall math scores.  Their rank remained unchanged for overall reading scores.

However, the number of students passing math dropped from 93% passing to 67% passing rate (7th ranked to 9th ranked).  Reading pass rates dropped from 97% to 70% (dropped school rank from 1st to ranked last in this category).

This leads to questions that may help shed light on the results, particularly about failure rates compared to other High Schools.  While the test averages by school and by grade appear to be in line with other schools, slicing the data by total number of failures revealed another perspective.  Thomas HS only had 5% of its freshmen fail math compared to all other high schools.  Whereas 19% of Thomas HS freshmen failed reading compared to the 15% for all other freshmen combined.  This may indicate that math results warrant further scrutiny in particular.

Comparative school performance
---
Next, Thomas High Schools math and reading scores were recalculated and re-assessed amongst the high- and low-performing schools.
Thomas HS dropped from second to eight overall.  Passing-math and passing-reading rates for the school dropped from the 90% rnage to 60% range (i.e. from top tier to middle of pack, and dead last among charter schools in all categories).



Math and Reading Scores by Grade
---
Since the questionable scores surrounded 9th graders only at Thomas High School, the changed performance results only manifested amongst 9th grade scores as expected.  Other school scores by grade remain unaffected in this report.  Thomas High school scores now show Not Available in the final output, but prior to this it was noted that while the averages were relatively unimpacted the math failure rate was significantly lower than all other schools by a factor of 3.

Scores by School Spending
---
Thomas High School falls into the third tier of spending per student.  In the $630-644 spent per student category, passing scores declined by six percent for math and declined by 7% for reading.  Results of other school spending did not change.

Scores by School Size
---
Thomas High School is a medium sized  high school.  Medium school size passing scores declined by six percent for both math and reading.  Results of other school size categories were not impacted.

Scores by School Type
---
As you would expect only the charter schools' passing rate was affected since only one charter school was identified as having invalid data.  Once this was removed, the charter schools' grades declined by 4% for both reading and math grades.
